# Churn_pred
This project aims to develop customer churn prediction model to identify customers at risk of cancelling their service. Using machine learning, we can analyze customer data and uncover patterns associated with churn behavior. This allows us to target at-risk customers with retention campaigns, ultimately boosting customer satisfaction and revenue.
